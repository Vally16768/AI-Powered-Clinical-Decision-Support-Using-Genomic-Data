Produce an **argumented diagnostic assessment** with the sections below, in order.
Keep the total between **8–14 bullets**. Each bullet ≤ 25 words when possible.

1) **Patient Snapshot (from EHR)**
   - One short line with available fields (e.g., age, sex, cancer_type, stage). If none: “EHR context not provided.”

2) **Key Genomic Evidence**
   - 2–5 bullets: most relevant variants (gene + variant_id) and why they matter diagnostically.
   - Mention ClinVar label and use scores only if needed for justification.
   - If a knowledge URL is provided, include it once near the related claim.

3) **Diagnostic Hypotheses (Ranked)**
   - 1–3 bullets. For each hypothesis:
     • Give a clear hypothesis of **molecular diagnostic relevance** (NOT a named disease/syndrome unless explicitly present in the input).
     • Assign a likelihood label (High/Moderate/Low/Indeterminate).
     • Justify by citing the exact supporting variants (gene + variant_id, ClinVar label, priority/score) and at most one knowledge URL.

4) **Uncertainties & Alternatives**
   - 1–2 bullets: conflicting/insufficient evidence (e.g., VUS, benign signals) and what this means for diagnostic confidence.

5) **Next Diagnostic Steps (confirmatory only)**
   - 1–3 bullets: bounded, evidence-linked **confirmatory diagnostic actions/tests** (e.g., orthogonal assay, classification criteria), strictly within the provided information.
   - No treatment/management advice.

6) **Limitations**
   - One bullet about data/model limitations (e.g., restricted evidence, unknown somatic vs. germline).

HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Use ONLY the input evidence and the provided knowledge URLs.
- Do NOT name or imply diseases/syndromes unless they appear in the EHR/knowledge.
- No treatment or prognostic recommendations.
- Keep concise and specific; avoid generic textbook prose.
